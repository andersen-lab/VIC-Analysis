# Data Analysis and Apps for VIC

Links to markdown notebooks are also hosted <a href="https://andersen-lab.github.io/VIC-Analysis/index.html">here</a>.

There are two submodules data-exporer and corr-network in this repository hosting the code for two applications we developed to explore the VIC dataset.

* [Correlation Network](http://apps.andersen-lab.com/corrnetwork/)
* [Data Explorer](http://apps.andersen-lab.com/vic-data-explorer/)

Links to the R markdown notebooks rendered as html pages are shown below.

* For the univariate analysis and clustering please see this R markdown file - [Analysis](https://andersen-lab.github.io/VIC-Analysis/analysis[exported].html)
* For the feature selection analysis without IIP transform(no change in performance) that selects for fewer features, please see - [Feature Selection](https://andersen-lab.github.io/VIC-Analysis/feature_selection[exported].html)
* For the feature selection analysis using the IIP transform on Neut_VSV and unNeutFrac(as in paper), please see - [Feature Selection with IIP transformation](https://andersen-lab.github.io/VIC-Analysis/feature_selection_iip[exported].html)
